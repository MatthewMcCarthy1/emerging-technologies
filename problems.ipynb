Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns False or always returns True) or balanced (returns True for exactly half of the possible input combinations). Write a Python function random_constant_balanced that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs."

    ">Deutsch's algorithm is designed to demonstrate a potential advantage of quantum computing over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function determine_constant_balanced that takes as input a function f, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze f and return the string \"constant\" or \"balanced\" depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call f to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"
